# New-Leaf
A web-based application that helps users define tasks and stay on track. Uses HTML, CSS, Bulma and Handlebars for the front-end, and MySQL, Express.js, body-parser, and method-override on the back end. This was my second project for coding boot camp, and all front-end work was built myself.
